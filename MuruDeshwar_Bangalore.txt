It is about an adventure that I had in 2018. It was my 4th month in Bangalore as I was relocated from Delhi due to my first Job. It was a struggle for me on the Initial day as  I was new to the place and it was the first time that I was living away from my parents.
I was very lonely and thought of leaving the Job and coming back to Delhi. I shared my thoughts with friends who tried to console me and convince me to stick with my Job.
