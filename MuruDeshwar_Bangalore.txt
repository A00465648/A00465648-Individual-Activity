It is about an adventure that I had in 2018. It was my 4th month in Bangalore as I was relocated from Delhi due to my first Job. It was a struggle for me on the Initial day as  I was new to the place and it was the first time that I was living away from my parents.
I was very lonely and thought of leaving the Job and coming back to Delhi. I shared my thoughts with friends who tried to console me and convince me to stick with my Job.

But to my surprise one week after I told my friends that I was getting homesick, I heard a knock on my apartment door at an odd hour. I opened my door and I was shocked to see friends who were supposed to be in Delhi on my doorstep. They planned an Impromptu trip to murudeshwar which was a small Island on the outskirts of Bangalore to cheer me up.

The next day we took to the bus to murudeshwar which was a 6hr hour journey. We reached the early morning, we rested ourselves and afterward, we went to Netrani Islands to experience scuba diving.
It was the best experience of my life, as I was able to overcome my fear of water and that nothing can beat watching the aquatic life while diving in the depth of the ocean.
Once we were back on the shore, we went to visit the famous Sri Murudeshwara Shiva temple which had a huge sculpture of God Shiva. The Entire trip was something that still makes me happy to date when I think about it.
