It is about an adventure that I had in 2018. It was my 4th month in Bangalore as I was relocated from Delhi due to my first Job. It was a struggle for me on the Initial day as  I was new to the place and it was the first time that I was living away from my parents.
I was very lonely and thought of leaving the Job and coming back to Delhi. I shared my thoughts with friends who tried to console me and convince me to stick with my Job.

But to my surprise one week after I told my friends that I was getting homesick, I heard a knock on my apartment door at an odd hour. I opened my door and I was shocked to see friends who were supposed to be in Delhi on my doorstep. They planned an Impromptu trip to murudeshwar which was a small Island on the outskirts of Bangalore to cheer me up.
